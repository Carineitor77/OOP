        <strong>The Development environment shouldn't be enabled for deployed applications.</strong>
        It can result in displaying sensitive information from exceptions to end users.
        For local debugging, enable the <strong>Development</strong> environment by setting the <strong>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</strong> environment variable to <strong>Development</strong>
        and restarting the app.
